The Happiness Score Predictor is a predictive modeling tool to observe how certain factors could affect national happiness rankings. The [*World Happiness Report 2024*](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2024/) consists of an analysis of global measures of subjective well-being and happiness. In addition, the report also contains data on variables that are strongly linked to subjective well-being. However, happiness rankings are not based on these variables, but rather national averages of the Cantril ladder. The variables are:
* **Life Ladder**: Happiness score/subjective well-being
* **GDP per capita**: GDP per capita in purchasing power parity at constant 2017 international dollar prices
* **Social support**: Having someone to count on in times of trouble; a national average of responses to the question: "If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?"
* **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: Average number of years that a person can expect to live in "full health" by taking into account years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury (Definition from the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/66)).
* **Freedom to make life choices**: National average of responses to the question "Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?"
* **Generosity**: Residual of regressing national average of response to the question "Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?" on GDP per capita.
* **Perceptions of corruption**: National average of the survey responses to two questions: "Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not" and "Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?"
* **Positive affect**: Average of three positive affect measures in GWP: laugh, enjoyment and doing interesting things in the Gallup World Poll. These
measures are the responses to the following three questions, respectively: "Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?", and "Did you experience the following
feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Enjoyment?", "Did you learn or do something interesting yesterday?"
* **Negative affect**: Average of three negative affect measures in GWP. They are worry, sadness and anger, respectively the responses to "Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Worry?", "Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Sadness?", and "Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Anger?"

I used data from the *World Happiness Report 2024* to train a machine learning model to predict happiness scores. The data comes from 2023 (as it is the latest data contained in the report). To use,  change the values corresponding to the variables to yield the predicted happiness score. **Please note that generated happiness scores are merely predictions based on the data and are not guaranteed to be accurate.**
